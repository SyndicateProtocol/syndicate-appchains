A comprehensive monorepo containing the complete Syndicate Appchains infrastructure stack.
This repository includes the core components for building, deploying, and managing syndicate appchains.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Syndicate Appchains enables the creation of custom rollups that utilize a two-source chain architecture:

- **Sequencing Chain**: Stores transaction data and handles appchain sequencing
- **Settlement Chain**: Manages fund bridging from/to the rollup

This design provides cost-effective, customizable sequencing while leveraging the liquidity and security of established blockchain networks.

### Core Components

#### Rust Services

- **synd-translator**: Reads block data from each source chain's ingestor, uses slotter logic to fit them into slots and transforms data into mchain blocks
- **synd-maestro**: Receives user appchain transactions and adds them to Redis streams (one stream per chain), where sequencers can read from. Handles transaction re-submission for re-orgs or sequencer failures
- **synd-batch-sequencer**: Reads from Redis transaction streams, batches/compresses transactions, then signs and publishes batches to the sequencing chain
- **synd-chain-ingestor**: Connects to source chains and builds a cache of (block_hash, timestamp) pairs for fast translator cold-sync. Reads new data from upstream RPC and forwards to translators
- **synd-mchain**: Stores mchain block data in RocksDB database. Implements the RPC API that rollup nodes expect when reading from Ethereum
- **test-framework**: Integration testing framework

#### Smart Contracts

- **synd-contracts**: Core system contracts including SystemConfig, AppchainFactory, Inbox/Outbox, and withdrawal system contracts

#### Withdrawal System

- **synd-enclave**: TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) component that receives block data from Ethereum L1, sequencing chain, and settlement chain, applies the rollup STF to derive rollup state, and signs state commitments enabling withdrawals
- **synd-proposer**: Connects TEE to settlement chain bridge. Feeds chain data to TEE enclave, obtains signed state commitments (sendRoot), and submits them to the TEEModule smart contract
- **synd-tee-attestation-zk-proofs**: Multi-component system for TEE attestation:
  - **aws-nitro**: Validates TEE attestation documents signed by Amazon's x509 root certificate
  - **sp1**: SP1-specific implementation for generating and verifying ZK proofs of AWS Nitro attestation
  - **proof-submitter**: CLI tool for fetching TEE attestation, generating SP1-based ZK proofs, and submitting on-chain
