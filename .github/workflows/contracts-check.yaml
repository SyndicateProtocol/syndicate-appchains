# This workflow runs our Foundry tests and contract checks on the smart contracts in both `synd-contracts/src`.
# Whenever a change is made in those directories, this workflow makes sure everything still builds, passes tests, and that our Rust bindings are up to date.
# Keeping the Rust bindings up to date makes sure your Rust code always knows how to talk to your smart contracts correctly.
